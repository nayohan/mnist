# mnist_cnn

This project refer to book 'Deep Learning from scratch'. Machine recognize digit using machine learning with mnist database. 
The book explain python basics, perceptron, artificial neural network, convoulution neural network and deep learning.
I am student. learning about machine learning from september 27, 2017. Uloading code on github from April 5,2018 until learn TensorFlow.
