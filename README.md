This project refer to book 'Deep Learning from scratch'. Machine recognize digit using machine learning with mnist database. 
The book explain python basics, perceptron, artificial neural network, convoulution neural network and deep learning.

I am student learning about machine learning from september 24, 2017. Uloading code on github from April 5,2018 until learn TensorFlow. It 
work on making convolution neural network. 

First, Just make neural network using python.

Second, To training handwriting digit data. We ues numerical gradient. It is simple but it takse a long time for running. Almost 14days to learning 10000 iters.

Third, Now We need to reduce the time so replace numerical gradient with backpropagation. It takes just

Fourth,
